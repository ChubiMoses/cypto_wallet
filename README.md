# Etherium Wallet

Integrating Web3 into mobile is exhilarating. In this straightforward dApp, 
I've built a Crypto wallet from scratch using Flutter. 
This was made possible by leveraging key libraries:
bip39: for mnemonic generation.
hex, ed25519_hd_key, and web3dart: for generating public and private keys.
Molaris API: for fetching wallet balances and associated NFTs.
